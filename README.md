This code demonstrates a common issue with closures in JavaScript and TypeScript when using `setTimeout` within a loop.  The problem stems from how closures capture variables. In this case, the closure created by `setTimeout` doesn't capture the value of `i` at the time of its creation, but rather captures a reference to `i`. By the time `setTimeout` finally executes, the loop has already completed, and `i` holds its final value.  This results in the unexpected behavior. The solution shows how to properly capture the current value of `i` using an immediately invoked function expression (IIFE).
